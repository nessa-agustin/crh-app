# CREATIVEHOPE TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT

# Full Stack Test 

## Description

- Create a simple app that allows you to do basic authentication to a page with a name "testuser" and a password "password".
- After successfully authenticating, the app would display a list of users as provided by this API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users.
- Display the users' name, username, phone and company name.

## Guidelines

- You are free to ask for any clarification with the task.
- You are free to use any language or web framework you prefer (ie. NodeJS, PHP, Ruby/Rails).
- Please include a readme on how to setup and run your app (if you can include a dockerfile better).
- Use git to store your code and commit often.
- Submit the test as a github repo or a zip file.

## What we care about
- We are looking at how you think and how you solve the problems.
- We are looking at how you code and how you communicate.
- Don't spend much time on UI on this test as long as it's readable, it's fine.
- If you feel you don't have enough time to solve, send what you've done anyway. We are not looking for
completeness as we understand you have other commitments.
- Aim for writing simple, clean and maintanable code


## Setup Guide
- run `npm install` to install dependencies
- run `npm dev` to run both backend (server.js) and frontend (react app)
